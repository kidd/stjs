We have come a long way since we listed the contents of a directory in <x key="systems-programming"></x>.
Saving files in version control,
making sure code meets style rules,
instrumenting it and bundling it---programmers do these things every day,
and we hope that understanding how they work will help you do them better.

We also hope that your journey won't stop here.
In particular,
contributions of all kinds are welcome,
from errata and minor improvements to entirely new sections and chapters.
Please file an issue submit a pull request in
[our GitHub repository][stjs-repo].
Everyone whose work is incorporated will be acknowledged.
Please see <x key="contributing">the contributors' guide</x> for more information,
and please note that all contributors are required to abide by
our <x key="conduct">Code of Conduct</x>.
